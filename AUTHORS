libzc is developed and maintained by Marc Ferland
<marc.ferland@gmail.com>.

Parts of this software were inspired by fcrackzip (by Marc Lehmann)
and pkcrack (by Peter Conrad).

The initial plaintext attack algorithm was devised by Eli Biham and
Paul C. Kocher in their paper "A Known Plaintext Attack on the PKZIP
Stream Cipher".
